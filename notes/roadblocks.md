# Roadblocks

## Different Testnets

ENS supports Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli
Chainlink Keepers: Mainnet and Kovan

Blocker: They don't have any overlapping testnets, so I'm not sure how to navigate this.
Thoughts: Maybe I create a mock contract to check the ENS availability.
Actions: I've asked in the chainlink discord for support. 
TODO: Research Mock contracts, their use cases, and if this is a good use case.
